        <h4>Traffic Control Algorithms Implementation</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Objectives:</strong> Utilise Software-Defined Networking to
          optimise network performance and ensure efficient resource utilization
        </p>

        <p><strong>Tools:</strong></p>
        <p>Front-End: JavaScript (React); Back-End: Rust</p>

        <p><strong>Duties:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Configure network emulation within a Docker container for efficient

          </li>
          <li>
            Utilise Mininet to create intricate networking topologies tailored
            for load testing purposes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Develop a load balancer using Software-Defined Networking (SDN)
            principles with the RYU controller in Python to optimise network
            traffic distribution
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Outcome:</strong></p>
        <p class="outcome">
          Implementing a load balancer enhances packet distribution and
          optimises network resource utilisation. Meanwhile, by establishing a
          closed and controlled testing environment within Docker for customised
          network emulation, you ensure optimal testing conditions and accurate
          performance assessment
