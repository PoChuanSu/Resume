            I am a <strong>software engineer</strong> with one and a half years
            of experience in developing and implementing software solutions. My
            experience includes working on both front-end (React) and back-end
            (Rust) development, collaborating in agile teams, and continuously
            learning and adapting to new technologies. As a customer service
            engineer and university tutor, I have developed excellent
            communication skills and the ability to explain complex concepts
            clearly, which enhances my ability to collaborate with team members,
            clients and students, ensuring that technical solutions meet user
            needs. I am dedicated to delivering high-quality code and
            contributing to the success of my team and projects.
